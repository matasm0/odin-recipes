This project helps solidiy the lesson material that we have learned thus far. It really helped me remember these things because I tried my best to complete this entirely without looking back at the material, and for the most part, I was able to. The only issue I had was using "list" for list items instead of "li", but otherwise, no problems. Easy, though it got a little monotonous, but fun!
